        This method creates all of the widgets character selector page.
        The information about each character should be derived from self.roster, 
        which is a CharacterRoster loaded from battle_characters.txt. 
        The layout should NOT be hard-coded: if you re-order, alter, or remove entries 
        in battle_characters.txt, the layout should automatically reflect those changes.

        The radio buttons on this page should all use the variable "self.character_index_index".  
        The values of the radio buttons must be a number equally the position of the character in the list. 
        For example, if the characters listed are Troll, Elf, Human, and Dwarf.  self.character_index would equal 0 
        for the Troll, 1 for the Elf, and so forth.  
        
        The variable self.character_index has been instantiated for your convenience below.
